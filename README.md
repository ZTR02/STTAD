# STTAD
STTAD is a dataset we propose for road traffic accident detection from surveillance views, featuring fine-grained classification and spatiotemporal annotations. This repository provides examples from the training and testing sets to showcase the data structure. The full dataset and related algorithms will be gradually updated.<br>

Update: The paper 《Surveillance-based Spatial Temporal Traffic Accident Detection: A novel Dataset and tailored Algorithm》 has been accepted by ITSC. The dataset will be released after the official publication. If you have any questions, please contact the authors via 220243471@seu.edu.cn.
